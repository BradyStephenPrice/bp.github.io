Developing organic nutrients with studying cyanobacteria, and trichomes. Previously, was a head cultivation manager at a state-of-the-art indoor commercial grow facility in Colorado where he implemented all facility standard operating procedures, creating an increased production from 330 pounds to 1500 pounds with in a year. Multiple records for THC of 30% or greater, such as, Banana OG at 31.59% and Chem 4 at 31.4%. Following after Organic Innovations became and started a partnership with Sunrise Genetics conducting a selective breeding with multiple thc and cbd chemotype cultivars. Straight into hemp farming producing twenty thousand dried pounds on five acres with my organic regiments. Development one of a kind custom machinery including a harvester and plant stripper. Built, ran, owned a full extraction lab with 15 pound chilled butane closed loop extractor, with full rotary evaporators and a 20L short path distiller with a flash chromatography. Partnered with Dinaminica Generale from Italy with a NIR nutrient scanner for hemp and cannabis, programed spectrometer levels with the AgriNIR machine. Nutrient ferments and new rhizophagy studies with cyanobacteria biology is my great understanding in nutrient, pest and disease control. Using bacillus and mycelium management with fine skill and timing creating a excellent understanding of environmental control.\nCheck out my projects through the years!\n","date":"8 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/bp.github.io/bio/","section":"Biography","summary":"","title":"Biography","type":"bio"},{"content":"","date":"8 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/bp.github.io/bio/cyanobateria/","section":"Biography","summary":"","title":"Cyanobateria","type":"bio"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/bp.github.io/books/","section":"Books","summary":"","title":"Books","type":"books"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/bp.github.io/bio/fractal_growth/","section":"Biography","summary":"","title":"Fractal Growth","type":"bio"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/bp.github.io/bio/fractal_growth/grease/","section":"Biography","summary":"","title":"Grease","type":"bio"},{"content":" Learn from Brady Price on how to!

Use immediately after the recommended interval, at this point dilute at a rate of 1:1 all the way up to 1:50 (For example: a 5 gallon brew is added to another 5 gallons of water all the way up to 250 gallons of water and immediately drenched or sprayed on the plants). You use it immediately because the living organisms that have been awoken are at a peak level and need to be unleashed into their new environment so they can thrive and set up the ideal environment for nutrient exchange with your plants/soil. Any extra- put it out on your favorite plants outside, any tree or even grass will benefit immensely.\nBrew instructions (scale this to however many gallons you are brewing):\n5 gallons water\n1-2 cups Bison Brew\n2-4 TBS unsulfured Molasses\nOptional boost: 2 TBS Grease Gold(or any color Label), 2-4 TBS Blue Grease, 2-4 TBS Alfa Grease, 2-3 cups aged wood chips (preferably deciduous softwood or hardwood)\nTop Dress or Compost instructions:\nApply 1-2 TBS evenly on top of the soil and scratch into the first 1-2\u0026quot; of soil. Water as you normally do and reapply every 2-3 weeks depending on the size of the plant.
