Using a novel approach of vacuum oven isolation in nitrogen-free media with maltose and a specialized 90-mineral salt mix, we isolated and cultured the cyanobacteria under controlled conditions. A dark bioreactor setup with maltose as a substrate with a short-path distiller was employed to cultivate the cyanobacteria. The experimental results demonstrate that the bioreactor generated a pressure differential ranging from -28 inHg to 0 inHg, within a 6 to 12-hour timeframe, per gallon of maltose, depending on distillation efficiency. This research presents a promising avenue for the use of Nostoc cyanobacteria in bioreactor systems and microbial fuel cell applications.\nIsolation bacteria inside cyanobateria 1. Introduction # Cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, are versatile microorganisms with numerous applications in biotechnology, including biofuel production, bioremediation, and carbon sequestration. Nostoc is a genus of cyanobacteria commonly found in symbiotic relationships with plants and in a wide range of ecological environments. Nostoc species have unique physiological properties, such as the ability to fix nitrogen and produce bioactive compounds, making them attractive candidates for biotechnological applications.\nThis project focuses on isolating and culturing cyanobacteria from Nostoc algae found in the wild grasses of Colorado. Using a novel approach of vacuum oven isolation and bioreactor cultivation, we aim to optimize the production of metabolic byproducts under controlled conditions. Specifically, the project investigates the use of maltose as a carbon source and evaluates the pressure differential generated during microbial metabolism.\n2. Objectives # Isolate Nostoc cyanobacteria from wild grass samples collected in Colorado. Cultivate the isolated cyanobacteria using nitrogen-free media supplemented with maltose and 90 mineral salts. Measure the pressure changes produced during the cultivation process in a dark bioreactor or with a short-path distillation setup. Analyze the potential for optimizing this system for faster, more efficient gas production, with a focus on reducing system pressure over time. Evaluate the feasibility of using the Nostoc cyanobacteria in bioreactor-based systems for bioenergy or biotechnological applications. 3. Materials and Methods # 3.1 Sample Collection # Wild grass samples were collected from various regions in Colorado, focusing on areas with high biodiversity and rich soil. Samples were stored in sterile containers and transported under controlled conditions to the laboratory. 3.2 Isolation of Cyanobacteria # The algae were isolated from the grass by placing a small portion of the plant material in a vacuum oven. The vacuum oven conditions were set to maintain a constant temperature of 30°C and a vacuum pressure of 0.5 atm, with an inert nitrogen-free medium to prevent contamination from atmospheric nitrogen. The isolation media consisted of: Nitrogen-free mineral salts (90 salts) 1% maltose as the carbon source Distilled water The system was maintained under these conditions for a period of 3 months to encourage growth while preventing contamination by external microorganisms.\n3.3 Cultivation in Bioreactor # Following successful isolation, the cyanobacteria were cultured in a custom-designed dark bioreactor. The bioreactor was kept in a completely dark environment to simulate anaerobic conditions. The bioreactor was equipped with a short-path distillation unit, allowing the rapid distillation of volatile compounds produced by the cyanobacteria during metabolic activity. Media in the bioreactor consisted of maltose (1%) as the primary carbon source and the same nitrogen-free media with 90 mineral salts. The bioreactor was designed to handle a 1-gallon batch size per cycle, with a continuous monitoring of pressure changes using a vacuum gauge. 3.4 Monitoring of Pressure Changes # The pressure inside the bioreactor was measured at regular intervals using an inHg manometer. Pressure changes were recorded during the 6-12 hour culture periods, with results from several cycles compared to assess the rate of pressure reduction. Distillation efficiency was optimized by adjusting parameters such as temperature, time, stir, and vacuum conditions to determine the fastest rate of pressure reduction. 4. Results # The bioreactor system generated a pressure differential ranging from -28 inHg to 0 inHg over a 6 to 12-hour period per gallon of maltose, depending on the distillation conditions. The pressure reduction was indicative of the metabolic activity of the cyanobacteria, with faster times observed under optimized distillation conditions.\n4.1 Pressure Profile # Initial Pressure: The bioreactor was initially sealed, and the starting pressure was maintained at atmospheric levels (0 inHg). Pressure Drop Start: Vaccumed to -28 hg and stirriing begins. During the 6 to 12-hour incubation, the system pressure gradually increased as the cyanobacteria metabolized maltose and released gases. Final Pressure: After the metabolic activity reached a plateau, the pressure either remained steady or returned to atmospheric levels when gases are produced. Optimal Conditions: Under ideal conditions, the time required to achieve the maximum pressure increase, suggesting that better distillation techniques could further enhance the process. 4.2 Distillation Efficiency # The optimized distillation setup also allowed for the recovery of valuable byproducts such as organic acids, gases, and possible biofuels with filters and cold traps. 5. Discussion # The isolation of Nostoc cyanobacteria from Colorado wild grasses and their cultivation in a controlled dark bioreactor environment demonstrated a promising approach for microbial metabolism-driven pressure generation. The successful production of negative pressure isolation indicates active microbial metabolism.\nThe pressure profiles observed can be further optimized by refining the distillation parameters to reduce the time required for gas production, which has implications for applications in bioenergy generation, microbial fuel cells, nitrogen fixing bacteria and bioreactor-based systems.\nFuture studies should explore:\nThe genetic characteristics of the isolated Nostoc strains to determine their metabolic pathways and stress tolerance. The scalability of this system for larger bioreactor setups. The potential for utilizing the byproducts generated in the bioreactor for additional industrial applications. 6. Conclusion # This project successfully isolated and cultivated Nostoc cyanobacteria from wild grasses in Colorado and demonstrated their potential in bioreactor systems for generating metabolic byproducts and positive pressure. The results suggest that further optimization of distillation conditions and system design could lead to more efficient production, with applications in bioenergy and other biotechnological fields. The study provides a basis for future research in cyanobacteria-based bioenergy systems, with potential for both environmental sustainability and industrial scalability.\n7.

After months of planning, research, and a little elbow grease, I’m excited to share the upgrades that have turned my van into a fully equipped and cozy home on wheels.\nThe first significant upgrade was the flooring. I opted for high-quality vinyl wood floors to give the van an elegant and natural look, while ensuring durability. The vinyl wood finish is easy to clean, resistant to wear, and provides warmth to the interior. It complements the insulated redwood finish that lines the walls and ceiling, giving the van a rustic yet modern feel. The rich tones of the redwood create a peaceful and inviting atmosphere, making it feel like a tiny cabin on wheels.\nTo power all the essentials, I installed a robust 3,000-watt inverter that ensures I can run everything from lights to small appliances without worrying about draining the battery. This inverter is the heart of the electrical system, providing reliable power for my day-to-day needs, whether I’m charging devices or running a fan for ventilation. The setup is perfect for extended stays off the grid, giving me peace of mind knowing that I have all the power I need at my fingertips. To manage the van’s electrical system efficiently, I integrated a dedicated circuit board that acts as the central hub for all the power distribution. This circuit board ensures that every component, from the 3,000-watt inverter to the diesel heater and 12V air conditioner, runs smoothly and safely. It allows for easy monitoring and control of power usage, with clear indicators for any issues, and ensures that the system is protected from overloads or short circuits. The added circuit board brings an extra layer of convenience and safety, keeping everything running in harmony and ensuring that I can rely on the van’s electrical system no matter where the road takes me.\nFor comfort, I installed a diesel heater, providing consistent warmth even on the coldest nights. The diesel heater runs efficiently, drawing fuel from the van’s tank, and is controlled by a user-friendly circuit board, allowing me to adjust the temperature to my liking. It’s been a game-changer for those chilly mornings when I wake up in the mountains or by a lakeside.\nKeeping cool is just as important, especially during the summer months. That’s why I added a 12V air conditioner, coupled with an additional fan to help circulate the cool air. The compact air conditioning unit is incredibly efficient and runs smoothly on the van’s electrical system, giving me relief from the heat without overburdening the battery.\nAnother key feature is the legless side canopy, which provides instant shade when I park the van at a campsite or during a midday break. The design is sleek and practical, with a retractable frame that extends and stows away easily, giving me an additional outdoor space that’s protected from the sun. Whether I’m sitting outside enjoying a meal or just relaxing, the canopy provides a comfortable retreat from the elements.\nThe finishing touch on the outside of the van is the Bison logo sticker, which adds a personal flair to my Sprinter. It’s a subtle yet bold symbol of strength and adventure, reflecting my love for the open road and my connection with the outdoors. It’s the perfect statement piece that lets others know this van is ready to tackle whatever comes its way.\nEvery upgrade to my Mercedes-Benz Sprinter Van was carefully thought out to enhance my experience on the road.

With the Bison logo proudly displayed, this van is more than just a vehicle — it’s a companion for every journey.\n","date":"1 January 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/bp.github.io/bio/fractal_growth/spriter_van/","section":"Biography","summary":"","title":"Sprinter Van","type":"bio"},{"content":"","date":"20 July 2018","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/bp.github.io/bio/dinaminica_generale/","section":"Biography","summary":"","title":"Dinaminica Generale","type":"bio"},{"content":"","date":"14 July 2018","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/bp.github.io/categories/harvester/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"“Harvester”","type":"categories"},{"content":"Building a One-of-a-Kind Cannabis Harvester: A Unique Project in Agricultural Innovation\nAs someone who is passionate about both cannabis cultivation and the intricacies of agricultural machinery, I embarked on a truly unique and ambitious project: creating a custom cannabis harvester. This machine would not only revolutionize the way cannabis is harvested but also be a testament to my creativity and problem-solving skills. The goal was to design and build a harvester that could strip cannabis flowers from the plants efficiently and gently, while also adapting to various types of equipment. The result would be a versatile, high-performing machine tailored specifically to the delicate needs of cannabis farming.\nThe project began with a partnership with Shelbourne, a highly respected manufacturer based in England, known for their expertise in custom agricultural equipment. They helped bring my vision to life by crafting an 8-foot right-hand auger header — the first and only one of its kind in the world. The auger header would serve as the key component for harvesting cannabis, as it would pull the plants through the machine, using the auger to gently strip the flowers from the stems. This step was crucial, as the flowers must be harvested without causing damage, which is a challenge when working with the fragile buds of cannabis plants.\nThe design of the auger header was carefully thought out to ensure that the harvesting process would be as efficient and gentle as possible. Traditional harvesting machines often damage the flowers, leading to wasted product and lower-quality yields. However, by customizing the header’s teeth and auger system, I was able to develop a solution that could delicately strip the flower buds while leaving the stems intact. This was a game-changer, as it allowed for the flowers to be moved onto the belt system without any unnecessary handling or stress, preserving their quality for further processing.\nOnce I had the header designed, I turned my attention to adapting it for use with a variety of loaders. The challenge was to create a versatile attachment system that would allow the auger header to be easily mounted onto any loader, making the harvester adaptable to different environments and scales of production. I customized the attachment mechanism so that the header could be quickly and securely connected to various types of loaders, whether they were small, medium, or large-scale machines. This flexibility ensures that the harvester could be used for a wide range of applications, from small boutique farms to larger industrial operations.\nThe next step was integrating the auger header with a larger Bobcat tractor. I designed a custom bumper holder to attach the harvester to the tractor, making sure that everything was securely fastened and ready for action. To further enhance the functionality, I created an attachment plate specifically designed to connect the conveyor belt system to the auger header. This allowed the harvested cannabis flowers to be moved onto the belt, where they would then travel up into a dump trailer for easy transport. The entire setup was designed to create a continuous, seamless flow from harvesting to storage, ensuring that the system operated smoothly from start to finish.\nOne of the most crucial components of the design was the custom conveyor belt system. Cannabis flowers are delicate, and traditional harvesting methods often lead to damage or loss of product during transport. To avoid this, I added protective sides and bumpers around the belt, ensuring that the flowers would be moved safely without falling off or becoming damaged. The bumpers prevented the flowers from getting caught or jostled, while the sides kept the flowers securely on track as they were conveyed to the trailer.\nAnother important feature was the custom-designed teeth on the auger header. These teeth were carefully engineered to strip the flowers from the stems without causing any harm to the delicate buds. Traditional harvesting machines often fail to achieve this delicate balance, causing the flowers to be crushed or damaged during the stripping process. However, with the custom teeth, I was able to create a system that effectively separated the flowers from the stems, while keeping the buds intact and in top condition for processing. As the flowers were stripped from the plants, the auger would move them onto the conveyor belt, which would then transport them up into the dump trailer.\nThe custom cannabis harvester I designed is more than just a machine; it’s a solution to the specific challenges faced by cannabis cultivators. The versatility of the design allows the harvester to be used with different types of equipment, while the custom modifications ensure that the flowers are handled with care. From the specialized auger header to the adaptable loader attachment system, every aspect of the machine was designed with efficiency, gentleness, and ease of use in mind. This harvester is the perfect blend of innovative engineering and practical functionality, making it a game-changer for anyone looking to streamline their cannabis harvesting process.\nIn addition to its technical features, the harvester is a testament to the power of customization. By carefully considering every aspect of the machine’s design and tailoring it to meet the specific needs of cannabis cultivation, I was able to create a tool that is not only efficient but also perfectly suited to the unique challenges of the cannabis industry. From the initial concept to the final product, the project has been a labor of love, and I’m incredibly proud of the result. It’s a machine that combines cutting-edge technology with practical solutions, and it’s a true one-of-a-kind harvester that will make cannabis harvesting faster, easier, and more effective than ever before.\n","date":"14 July 2018","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/bp.github.io/bio/cannabis_harvester/","section":"Biography","summary":"","title":"Cannnabis Harvaster","type":"bio"},{"content":"","date":"14 July 2018","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/bp.github.io/tags/harvester/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Harvester","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"8 July 2018","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/bp.github.io/bio/orkel/","section":"Biography","summary":"","title":"Orkel","type":"bio"},{"content":"","date":"8 May 2018","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/bp.github.io/tags/laboratory/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Laboratory","type":"tags"},{"content":"Building My Custom Cannabis Laboratory: A State-of-the-Art Facility for Extraction and Distillation\nAs a passionate advocate for innovation in the cannabis industry, I set out to create a laboratory that would not only meet the highest standards of safety and efficiency but also push the boundaries of what could be achieved in cannabis extraction and refinement. This ambitious project involved extensive planning, custom installations, and meticulous attention to detail to build a fully functional, high-tech facility capable of handling every step of the cannabis processing workflow — from initial cleaning to advanced separation techniques. The result is a fully equipped, three-room laboratory designed for everything from winterization and distillation to butane extraction and chromatography.\nElectrical and Power Infrastructure: A Foundation for Precision\nThe backbone of my laboratory’s functionality began with the installation of a robust electrical system to support all the specialized equipment. I installed a dedicated 200-amp service to ensure the lab had more than enough power for everything from the heavy-duty extraction machines to the fine-tuned distillation apparatus. In addition to the 200-amp service, I incorporated a custom side inverter capable of providing 220V single-phase power, specifically for the Euro chiller required for certain processes like winterization. This chiller, crucial for cooling solvents and ensuring optimal extraction, needed a dedicated power source to function at peak efficiency. The integration of these power systems not only supported the smooth operation of the laboratory but also ensured that each component had the necessary power to perform under demanding conditions.\nDesigning the Lab: Three Specialized Rooms for a Complete Workflow\nThe layout of the laboratory was designed with careful consideration for both efficiency and safety. I divided the lab into three distinct rooms, each dedicated to a specific stage of the cannabis extraction process. This division ensures a clean, organized workflow that minimizes contamination and maximizes the effectiveness of each stage. The lab begins with a wash and clean room, an essential first step in ensuring that all equipment, tools, and materials entering the lab are thoroughly sanitized before being exposed to sensitive extraction processes.\nThe clean room is equipped with an advanced filtration system, air purifiers, and drying equipment to ensure that the space remains sterile, preventing any contamination that could compromise the quality of the final product. Once everything is properly cleaned, it enters the main central room, which is the heart of the operation. This large, open space houses the more complex extraction and distillation equipment, including multiple rotary evaporators, a short-path distiller, a vacuum oven, and a flash chromatography setup — all critical tools for separating and refining the cannabis extract.\nMain Central Room: Extraction, Distillation, and Separation\nIn the main center room, I set up the equipment for winterization and refinement. Winterization is an essential process for cannabis extraction, as it removes unwanted waxes and lipids from the extract. This is accomplished through the Euro chiller, which chills the extracted material to temperatures low enough to precipitate out these impurities. The rotary evaporators, three in total, allow for solvent removal, which is a crucial step in ensuring the final extract is pure and concentrated. The short-path distiller is used for further refining the distillate, purifying the cannabinoids to a high degree of potency.\nAdditionally, I’ve incorporated a vacuum oven into the setup, which serves multiple purposes, including solvent removal under controlled heat and vacuum, which prevents the degradation of delicate compounds. Flash chromatography is the final step in the separation process, ensuring that I can isolate specific cannabinoids, terpenes, and other compounds to create a variety of products, each with the desired properties. The integration of these tools into one room allows for a seamless, efficient workflow, making it easier to manage the distillation and refinement process in one centralized space.\nButane Extraction Room: Safety, Efficiency, and Precision\nThe next room in the lab is dedicated to butane extraction, which is commonly used for producing concentrates such as shatter, wax, and live resin. Since butane extraction involves volatile gases, safety was paramount when designing this room. I equipped the room with specialized explosion-proof fans and lights, ensuring that any potential sparks or heat sources are minimized. These precautions are essential for maintaining a safe working environment when dealing with flammable solvents.\nInside the extraction room, I installed a fully closed-loop butane extraction system that features chilled jackets, ensuring that the butane is kept at optimal temperatures throughout the process. This closed-loop system helps recover and recycle the butane, reducing waste and increasing the efficiency of the extraction process. The chilled jackets ensure that the extraction process remains at the ideal temperature for maximum yield and purity. The room is equipped with temperature and pressure sensors, which continuously monitor the extraction system to ensure everything is operating within safe and efficient parameters.\nCreating a Safe and Clean Environment\nEach room of the lab was built with safety and cleanliness in mind. The walls were constructed from stud framing, with drywall and durable finishes to maintain a sterile environment. The lab was carefully designed to meet all necessary codes and regulations, with features like fire suppression systems, chemical storage units, and emergency shutdown procedures to handle any unforeseen situations.\nThe sensors I installed in various areas of the lab are critical for monitoring environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, and airflow. These sensors provide real-time data to ensure that the lab is operating under optimal conditions. If any parameter deviates from the desired range, the system triggers an alert, allowing me to take corrective action before it becomes an issue. Additionally, the fans and ventilation systems in each room are specifically tailored to control airflow and remove fumes, ensuring that the laboratory remains safe and efficient for workers.\nConclusion: A State-of-the-Art Cannabis Lab for Quality Extraction\nThe culmination of years of planning, research, and customization, this laboratory represents the next frontier in cannabis processing. The carefully designed layout, combined with the custom electrical systems, advanced extraction technologies, and safety measures, makes this facility a state-of-the-art operation for cannabis refinement. From the wash and clean room, through the main center room with its array of distillation and separation equipment, to the butane extraction room with its explosion-proof systems, every aspect of this lab was crafted with precision and care. This facility not only allows for high-quality cannabis extraction but also sets a new standard in terms of safety, efficiency, and innovation, and I’m proud to have created a one-of-a-kind laboratory capable of producing the finest cannabis concentrates on the market.\n","date":"8 May 2018","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/bp.github.io/bio/laboratory/","section":"Biography","summary":"","title":"Laboratory","type":"bio"},{"content":"","date":"1 February 2018","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/bp.github.io/bio/plant_stripper/","section":"Biography","summary":"","title":"Plant Stripper","type":"bio"},{"content":"","date":"20 July 2017","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/bp.github.io/bio/western_bakery/","section":"Biography","summary":"","title":"Western Bakery","type":"bio"},{"content":"","date":"20 April 2017","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/bp.github.io/bio/organic_innovations/","section":"Biography","summary":"","title":"Organic Innovations","type":"bio"},{"content":"","date":"1 April 2017","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/bp.github.io/bio/reims_farm/","section":"Biography","summary":"","title":"Reims Farm","type":"bio"},{"content":"","date":"8 January 2017","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/bp.github.io/bio/dna_sequencing/","section":"Biography","summary":"","title":"Dna Sequencing","type":"bio"},{"content":"","date":"20 April 2015","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/bp.github.io/bio/organic_alternative/","section":"Biography","summary":"","title":"Organic Alternatives","type":"bio"},{"content":"","date":"20 April 2006","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/bp.github.io/bio/vegetables/","section":"Biography","summary":"","title":"Vegetables","type":"bio"},{"content":"Alfa Grease SOP\nWeight of pot in Grams\n12galx 3,785g = 45,420gram water for big pot with 1000grams alfa 150F hold for 20-30mins 283F hold for 1 hour Cold to 90F\n38,250grams - Alfa Extract X 1.15 = 15% 43,987.5 - Total Weight\n43,987g\n38,250g = 5,737g Ethanol (– Grease Gram After for total) x.25 1,434g Grease (-) Grease Grams from Ethanol Grams\nStir and Bottle\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/bp.github.io/bio/fractal_growth/grease/alfa_grease/","section":"Biography","summary":"","title":"Alfa Grease","type":"bio"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/bp.github.io/bio/fractal_growth/grease/amber_grease/","section":"Biography","summary":"","title":"Amber Grease","type":"bio"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/bp.github.io/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"Bison Compoast\nBison are herbivores, while cows are omnivores, and this difference in diet can result in variations in the types and amounts of microbes present in their manure.\nHow to Brew:\nIt is recommended to make a 12-24 hour aerated compost tea for plants in the vegetative phase, and make a 24-48 hour aerated compost tea for plants in the boom phase.

Any extra- put it out on your favorite plants outside, any tree or even grass will benefit immensely.\nBrew instructions (scale this to however many gallons you are brewing):\n5 gallons water\n1-2 cups Bison Brew\n2-4 TBS unsulfured Molasses\nOptional boost: 2 TBS Grease Gold(or any color Label), 2-4 TBS Blue Grease, 2-4 TBS Alfa Grease, 2-3 cups aged wood chips (preferably deciduous softwood or hardwood)\nTop Dress or Compost instructions:\nApply 1-2 TBS evenly on top of the soil and scratch into the first 1-2\u0026quot; of soil. Water as you normally do and reapply every 2-3 weeks depending on the size of the plant. Larger plants may require more frequent intervals, and larger doses.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/bp.github.io/bio/fractal_growth/grease/bison_brew/","section":"Biography","summary":"","title":"Bison Brew","type":"bio"},{"content":"Bison Extract SOP\n12:1 w/20 Ethanol\nOne Tube= 4-5 coffee filters\n3LB of Bison Brew 36LB of Water at 100F\n4LB of Bison Brew 48LB of Water at 100F\n5hr Extract After add 20% Ethanol Bottle\n3lb Bison Compost x 12lb Water = 36lb Total If \u0026mdash;- 4 x 12= 48lb\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/bp.github.io/bio/fractal_growth/grease/bison_extract/","section":"Biography","summary":"","title":"Bison Extract","type":"bio"},{"content":"Seed Coat SOP\nH20 Weight in Grams/.75= Total Weight in Grams\nTotal Weight x .25 =\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/bp.github.io/bio/fractal_growth/grease/bison_seed_coat/","section":"Biography","summary":"","title":"Bison Seed Coat","type":"bio"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/bp.github.io/bio/fractal_growth/grease/bloom_grease/","section":"Biography","summary":"","title":"Bloom Grease","type":"bio"},{"content":"Blue Grease SOP\nHACCP team member washes hands, put gloves on before all production\nClean tools, (stainless pots, holding jars,table,induction heater,Spoon, cooling unit and scale) Weigh filtered RO water to grams Add blue alge to 2 grams per 3,785.41 grams of water Heat to 90F and hold for 10mins Add 500mL of cannabinoid extract from Grease Gold Label to 1 gallons of water Bottle to wieght Label batch number Log batch MIXING 3 Gallons\n3,785.41 x 3 = 11356.23 grams H20 500 x 3 = 1500 grams Grease Gold\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/bp.github.io/bio/fractal_growth/grease/blue_grease/","section":"Biography","summary":"","title":"Blue Grease","type":"bio"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/bp.github.io/bio/organic_innovations/80acre_farm/","section":"Biography","summary":"","title":"CR.17 -
